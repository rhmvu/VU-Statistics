Exercise 2.1 
Exercise 1.6 from the set of additional exercises.
Hand in: Answers with your calculations and explanations.


Exercise 2.2
Consider the experiment of tossing a biased coin for which the probability of heads coming up equals 0.7. We assume that multiple coin tosses do not influence each other.
a) Describe the probability distribution, i.e. the possible values and their probabilities, of the random variable ‘number of heads in one coin toss’.
b) Describe the probability distribution, i.e. the possible values and their probabilities, of the random variable ‘number of heads in two coin tosses’.
c) What is the expected number of heads in two coin tosses?
d) Show analytically that the standard deviation of the variable ‘number of heads in one coin toss’ is approximately equal to 0.46.
e) Which distribution does the random variable ‘the mean number of heads per coin toss after n tosses’ have for large values of n (also give the expectation and standard deviation of the distribution)?
Hand in: Answers with your calculations and explanations.


R-exercises
Hints concerning R:
• Recall that a simple random sample of size n from a set of values x can be drawn in R using the function sample(x,n). By default, the sample is drawn without replacement; by setting the additional parameter replace to TRUE, the sample is drawn with replacement. This function can be used to simulate a die.
• A sample from a certain distribution can be obtained in R with the function rdist(n,par) where dist stands for the name of the distribution, n for the sample size, and par for the re- levant parameters: x=rnorm(50,5,1), x=rexp(25,1), x=runif(30,-1,1), x=rt(10,df=5), x=rchisq(25,df=8). For example, the function rnorm(n,mean,sd) generates a sample of
size n from the normal distribution with expectation mean and standard deviation sd. The parameters of the other distributions are documented in the help-function.
• A normal QQ plot can be obtained with qqnorm(x).
• The command dnorm(u) computes the value of the probability density function of the standard normal distribution in u. For non-standard normal distributions adjust the argu-ments of the function.
• The command lines(x,y) joins the corresponding points in the vectors x and y with line segments. This is useful to draw a curve on top of an existing plot. Similarly, abline(a,b) draws the line ax + b on top of an existing plot. Otherwise specify type="l" in the parameters of the function plot().
• If you want to concatenate text and numbers (which could be useful for instance for titles of plots) you could use the R-function paste().







Exercise 2.3
a) Generate the following samples and make for each of the four samples a normal QQ plot:
(i) one sample of size 40 from the t-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom;
(ii) one sample of size 35 from the N (2, 1) distribution;
(iii) one sample of size 45 from the chi-squared-distribution with two degrees of freedom;
(iv) one sample of size 55 from the uniform distribution on the interval [−1, 1].
What can you say about the shapes of these model distributions based on the QQ plots? Comment briefly on each plot.
Hand in: Present the 4 plots concisely using the command par(mfrow=c(2,2)).

b) Answer for each of the data sets below the following question: “Is it reasonable to assume that the data come from a normal distribution?” In each case choose from the two answers: “Obviously not from a normal distribution” or “Normality cannot be excluded”. Base your answer on histograms, boxplots and normal QQ-plots.
(i) klm.txt (delivery time in days of products by Boeing to KLM)
(ii) iqdata2.txt (IQ data)
(iii) dell.txt (trading volumes Dell shares)
(iv) logdell.txt (log trading volume Dell shares)

Hand in: Present for each data set: a suitable histogram, boxplot and QQ-plot, your answer to the question, and a short motivation of this answer. Use the function par(mfrow=c(1,3)) to print the three plots next to each other. Adjust the size of the





Exercise 2.4

Study the R-function maxdice from the file function2.txt. Load it by using the
command source("function2.txt").


a) Consider two dice and the random variable ‘the maximum on two dice’ (see Lecture 3). Illustrate the Law of Large Numbers for this random variable by considering ‘the mean of the maximum on two dice’ in n double rolls for different values of n and making a plot similar to the one on slide 24 of the Lecture 3 handout.

b) Use the function maxdice to find an approximate value of expectation of the random variable ‘the maximum on 5 dice’ and the probability of the event ‘the maximum on 2 dice is a 3’.

c) Use the function maxdice to illustrate the Central Limit Theorem for the random variable ‘the mean maximum value of two dice rolls after n double rolls’ for the present context of two dice rolls graphically, by making 4 plots similar to the 4 plots on slide 15 of the Lecture 4 handout.

d) Explain briefly why the 4 plots of part c) illustrate the Central Limit Theorem in the present context. Hand in: Properly described plots (part a and c), answers with motivation (parts b and d).
